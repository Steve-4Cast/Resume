title: "Green Home Installations: Resourcefulness Under Pressure"
---

My first day at Green Home Installations set the tone for a challenging experience that tested my adaptability and patience. When I arrived, no one seemed to know I was scheduled to start. I had no desk, no computer, and no clear understanding of my responsibilities. Though the title of “Project Manager” implied leadership and organization, the reality was entirely different.

In the early weeks, I quickly learned that resourcefulness was the most important skill. Instead of traditional project management, I spent most days driving long distances between job sites, ensuring materials were delivered and projects kept moving. Project managers were expected to use their own vehicles and tools, with reimbursement for gas delayed and cumbersome. Even acquiring basic materials was a struggle due to failing company cards and slow approvals. Each day required improvisation.

Despite these challenges, I committed myself fully to the work. My responsibilities often extended into manual labor: laying glass blocks, performing electrical tasks, digging trenches, and completing various hands-on projects—frequently learning as I went. Communication about schedules was sparse, and I often only knew the next day’s assignments through late-night group texts from the owner. The disorganized environment demanded constant flexibility and a positive attitude to keep projects and customer relationships on track.

Maintaining professionalism was paramount. The company relied heavily on subcontractors and a borrowed contractor’s license, which complicated permitting and client trust. I made it my mission to keep stakeholders informed and as satisfied as possible, even in less-than-ideal circumstances. This focus on communication became my anchor.

Ultimately, my time at Green Home Installations ended abruptly. While on a family vacation, I received an unexpected call notifying me of my termination. Though the ending was sudden, the season taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, the importance of structured leadership, and the ability to adapt in unpredictable work environments. 

Looking back, my time at Green Home Installations was unpredictable—an experience of hard lessons, unexpected responsibilities, and personal growth that shaped the way I approach every project and team in the future.
