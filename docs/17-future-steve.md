title: "Looking Ahead: Open to Possibilities"
---

In this moment of my life, I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, ready to leap and build the plane as I fall—the classic small business owner's metaphor. I’ve just created my own company, and while it’s still pre-revenue, the potential excites me. I’m wide open to possibilities: looking for partners, a team, mentorship, or even discovering a role in another company that recognizes my value and aligns with my principles. Wherever I land, I want to bring my diverse skills and life experience to shine, to solve problems creatively, and to help something meaningful grow.

I’ve always been a natural problem-solver, a kind of “Mr. Fix-It.” I thrive in situations where I can make systems more efficient, improve processes, or find creative solutions to tricky challenges. Whether in operations, software development, organizational leadership, or just rolling up my sleeves to help where needed, I have a lot to offer. I love blending my technical skills with my creative side—my passion for music, poetry, and art—to approach problems from unique angles.

Right now, my life is tied to the Charlotte and Knoxville region because I have teenagers at home, with my youngest still in middle school. In about five years, when she heads off to college, I’ll be more open to relocating. In the meantime, I’m completely capable of working remotely and supporting any company, anywhere in the world, if they see the potential in what I can contribute. I’m flexible about travel, willing to fly or drive as needed, though I prefer trips that keep me away for no more than a week at a time, with the understanding that expenses would be covered.

From building houses to building software—and now building businesses—the future feels like the next great project waiting to take shape. It’s a wide-open space, full of potential and purpose. I’m driven by the idea of creating things that last, whether that means advancing sustainability, helping companies reduce their carbon footprint, or designing systems that make work and life more efficient. Every step of my journey has reinforced the value of adaptability—of knowing when to zoom in on the smallest details and when to step back to see the bigger picture. That balance fuels my creativity and guides my approach to every challenge. My goal is to keep building—ideas, teams, and solutions that make a meaningful difference—and to find the place where purpose and possibility come together to shape a better future.
